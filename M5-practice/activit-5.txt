Step 1 : A stack object is created.
Step 2 : The first while loop repeats until the queue is empty.
Step 3 : The elemets that are dequeued from q are added to stack.
Step 4 : The second while repeats until the stack is empty.
Step 5 : Elements that are popped from stack are added back to queue.

On the whole the elements are just reversed in the queue.
