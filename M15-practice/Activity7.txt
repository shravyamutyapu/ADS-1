Question : Which of the symbol-table implementations in this section would you use for an application that does 10^6 put() operations and 10^3 get() operations, randomly intermixed?

Solution : The time complexity for sequential search is N.
& time complexity for binary search symbol table is logN
so its better to prefer the binary search .
