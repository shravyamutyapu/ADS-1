Suppose that the keys A through G , with the hash values given below, are inserted in some order into an initially empty table of size 7 using a linear-probing table (with no resizing for this problem). Which of the following could not possibly result from inserting these keys?

 KEYS : A B C D E F G
 HASH : 2 0 0 4 4 4 1

Solution :
After performing insertion operations it would result the following sequence :
        B C A G D E F

the above array does not occur in the given options :
a) E F G A C B D
b) C E B G F D A
c) B D F A C E G
d) C G B A D E F
e) F G B D A C E
f) G E C A D B F

therefore none of the above options satisfy the hashing technique shown in the question.
