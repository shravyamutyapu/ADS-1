Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, basic selection sort or basic insertion sort?

ans::

Although the time complexity of both the sorting methods are same in reverse order(N^2). I think selection sort run faster than insertion sort, when an array is in reverse order. The selection sort, sorts the array in less number of iterations than insertion sort.
